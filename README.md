1.What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem was trying to visualize the logistics of the structure. What should come first and should come last. All data structures have their differences, so trying to understand what to do with one type of structure was a problem. Building a vector was different than building a binary tree.
2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand?
I approach it like playing different levels of a video game, what works in one structure will be somewhat different in another type of structure. I have to learn surprising a lot more than I expected, luckily I was able to find the right solutions.
3. how did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
By looking at the problem wholistically, trying to analyze how one section of a structure connects to the structure as a whole. Codding can sometimes be a organizing a system of pipes, they all need to connect to keep the water going.
4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Learning and working with the different structures gives me a new view on how codding should be done. Codding can be more as a art form, different data structures fit not just different problems but different people. It also tight me that there is far more to learn than I thought.
5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Coding requires knowing what you are actually typing. Working on this project I have develop a more fine eye for detail. I try to not "over code" or make it into something that people can't easily use.
